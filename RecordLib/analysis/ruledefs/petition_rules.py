This collection of rule functions determine what Petitions can be generated from a crecord.

These rule functions take a CRecord, and return a tuple. The first member of the tuple
is a CRecord that represents the parts of the input CRecord that do _not_ meet the conditions 
of the rule. The second member of the tuple is a PetitionDecision (a Decision where the `value`
is a Petition object)

These rule functions are useful to pass into an `Analysis` and collect a set of `Petitions` to create for a user to 
expunge or seal their record.
