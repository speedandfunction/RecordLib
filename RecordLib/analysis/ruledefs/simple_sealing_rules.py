    Does `crecord` contain equal or more than `offense_limit` convictions for `grade_limit` (or more serious) offenses in the last `years` years?

    The limits are inclusive.

    For example, `more_than_x_convictions_y_grade_z_years(rec, 2, M1, 15)` would return a Decision that explains whether `rec` contains 
    2 or more M1-or-greater convictions in the last 15 years.

    Args:
        crecord: A criminal record.
        offense_limit: Are there more convictions than this number in this record?
        grade_limit: The grade (i.e. M1) that triggers this rule
        years: Years since a conviction that will be counted.
    
    Returns:
        A decision that is True if `crecord` contains more than the `offense_limit` of `grade_limit` convictions in the last `years` years.
